01.1: computational physics and computational science ----- 1
  longish distinction between computer science (CS), computational physics (CP)
01.2: Books subjects ----- 3
  touches on hardware a bit, basics of python
  most of the physics is in the back 2/3
  linear algebra, fourier transforms, wavelets
  SVD, PCD, fluid and soliton dynamics
  dotted O is optional
  table 1.1 and 1.2 describes rough course of events
01.3: Books problems ----- 4
  recommended 6 sections for report style solutions
    equations solved
    numerical method used
    source code
    visualiztion
    discussion
    critique
  codes for problem labels
    QM, CM, NL, EM, FD, SP, MM, CS, Th, BI
    NL= nonlinear, SP= statistical physics, FD=fluid dynamics, BI=biology, Th=thermal
  lengthy table clustering problems based on type
01.4: Books language ----- 8
  argument for why python is best for pedagogy
  a number of secondary references recommended for learning basics
  python packages
    discussion of a package, how one might use packages
    some shell examples

    an example of a decaying cosine and a scattered cosine
    figure 1.2
  vpython 2d plots
    description of listing1.1 code
    various options set and the likes
  listing 1.2 produces figure 1.3a
  listing 1.3 produces figure 1.4
  harmosAnimate produces figure 1.3b
  listing 1.4 produces figure 1.5a
  listing 1.5 produces figure 1.5b featuring error bars
  listing 1.6 produces figure 1.6 featuring subplots
  listing 1.7 produces figure 5.5 featuring scatter plots
  brief discussion about 3d plotting
  listing 1.8 produces figure 1.7 featuring 3d plot, probably better off as a heatmap
  listing 1.9 produces figure 1.8 featuring 3d scatter plot
  discussion about mayavi plotting techniques work and an example
