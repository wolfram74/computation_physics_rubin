04.1: deterministic randomness ----- p69
  Programs make use of stochastic seeming processes
04.2: random sequences ----- p69
  definitions provided for random sequence and uniformity
  probability distributions alluded to
  mechanisms for letting nature generate random numbers are described
  4.2.1 modulus random generation (power residue)
    r_i+1 = (ar_i + c)%M
    example calculation run through
    an illustration of correlated and less correlated data points
    some discussion of scale of cycles
  4.2.2 power residue shortcomings (exercise)
  4.2.3 measuring correlation and uniformity
    measuring these things is important if they are assumed to be true
    checks include
    1: looking at them
    2: plotting vs number count
    3: calculating the kth moment of the distribution to test uniformity
      involves k sums over N followed by goodness of fit to curve
    4: near neighbor correlation
      involves 1 sum over N followed by goodness of fit to constant
    5: scatter plot and visual inspection
    exercise, do kth moment comparison for 1,3 and 7 with N = 1E2, 1E4, 1E5
04.3: random walks (problem) ----- p75
  calculating collisions as a function of distance for brownian motion
  4.3.1 random walk simulation
  simple assumptions can lead to different kinds of diffusion
  brownian motion, normal diffusion, abnormal diffusion
  model in use stipulates arbitrary direction and some displacement at each step
  steps added euclideanly
  end result is vector distance should vanish, but root mean square distance does not
  4.3.2 discussing the implementation in list 4.1
  a number of things to do along the way to analyzing the random walk

04.4: extension: protein folding and self-avoiding random walks----- p79
  protein folding briefly described
  a crude simulation method described
04.5: spontaneous decay (problem) ----- p80
  decay rate problem outlined
  some description of decay probability is gone into for countable numbers of particles
  continuous limit discussed
  outlined psudeocode for the decay rate problem
04.6: decay implementation and visualization ----- p84
  checklist of things for project
