'''
1 try malignant first guesses
2 make a well deep enough to get several bound states
3 find a shallow enough well that the ground state is close to E=0
4 change width of well to see how binding changes
5 find 2 or more combinations of depth and width with equal ground states
6 modify to solve for odd wave functions (it doesn't already?)
7 explore a linear potential rather than a square well
8 compare time consumed on rk4 vs numerov
9 use newton raphson instead of bisection to search
