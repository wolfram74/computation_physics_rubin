'''
initial conditions, vary impact parameter and v_y
some possible parameters for scanning are given
plot a few cartesian (x,y) trajectories of interesting nature
plot a few configuration-space trajectories (x,vx), (v,vy)
    note scattering and non-scattering paths
experiment with attractive potentials as well as repulsive
time delay measurements?
