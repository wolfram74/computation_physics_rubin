chapter 09: ODE applications  eigenvalues, scattering and projectiles () 193
Overview of chapter subject, basically chapter title

09.1: problem: Quantum Eigenvalues in arbitrary potential ----- 193
brief review of wave functions and the schrodinger equation
recasting it in terms of wave vectors
pointing out how noramalizability makes it an eigen value or BC problem
assertions about symmetry that seem too strong
  ground state symmetric even in non-symmetric potentials?
9.1.1 nucleon in a box
  a simple square potential described
  a bit of algebra and numerical filling out

09.2: Algorithms: Eigenvalues via ODE solver + search ----- 195
a method for finding wave functions and eigen values is described
  specifying an outer bound to treat as infinity
  solve the ODE the boundaries to some matching point independently from both sides with a guessed energy
  using the disagreement between the two to guess at a better energy
9.2.1 numerov algorithm for schroginder ODE
  an alternative to rk4 is alluded to
  eq9.12: basic square well is described
  anti-symmetry of odd terms used to extra even terms
  some substitutions progress to eq9.20
9.2.2 implementation instructions
  progression for square well exercise described in square_well.py

09.3: explorations ----- 203
  stretch activities listed in explorations.py

09.4: problem: classical chaotic scattering ----- 203
  some scattering processes seem to have internal state change as part of the process
9.4.1 model
  a kind of 4-peaked maxwellian potential is defined
  initial velocity and impact parameter specified,
  outgoing theta measured
  eq9.23 gives a definition for experiments (and simulations)
  eq9.24 gives a definition of cross section for theory
  given certain potentials, very pathological cross sections can arise
  gradient for sample potential taken care of
  a maximum energy is derived
9.4.2 implementation
  my rk45 is still valid, especially the way I wrote it
  take |PE|/KE <10**-10 as "infinity"
  use arctan to get scattered angle out
9.4.3 assessment
  process described in scattering.py

09.5: Problem: balls falling out of the sky ----- 208
more realistic trajectories

09.6: theory: projectile motion with drag ----- 208
simple ballistics discussed
analytic solution fiated
friction introduced
power based models described
9.6.1 simultaneous second order ODEs
  rk45 is still useful
9.6.2 assessment
  done this problem enough, not interested


09.7: exercises: multi-body orbits and chaotic weather ----- 211
simple description of 2 body gravitation discussed
history recap of discovery of neptune
simplification of orbits to determine level of impact neptune has on uranus
