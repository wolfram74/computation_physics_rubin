'''
implement matching function like eq9.11
implement eigenvalue solver using matching subroutine
have searcher print out each iterations result, stop with convergence at 4 digit
    have limit to iterations depth and include warning
plot resulting wave function + potential +eigenvalue
    decide whether or not it's a ground state based on node count
search out other eigenvalues
compare with analytic results from previous exercise
