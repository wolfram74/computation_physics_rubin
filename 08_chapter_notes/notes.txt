chapter 08: Solving Differential equations NonLinear Oscillations p171
Numerical methods are rad because you can use them on anything, building up more complications in this chapter

08.1: Free Nonlinear Oscillations ----- 171
outlining the non harmonic oscillator and goals

08.2: Nonlinear Oscillators (models) ----- 171
standard sum of forces newton's second law deal
distinguishing internal and external forces
One exploration with a cubic deviation from harmonic potential
discussion of different regimes,
  close to 0, small effects
  close to 1/a but less than, anharmonic effects
  larger than 1/a no longer bound
second exploration posits even-powered potential wells in general

08.3: Types of Differential equations (math) ----- 173
definition of Order for a DiffEQ
  examples differentiating first order from higher order
definitions of ordinary and partial
  PDEs will be addressed in the last few chapters
distinction between linear and non-linear
  linear in differentials and function, may have non-linear independent terms
initial and boundary conditions
  discussing how initial conditions specify arbitrary constants
  boundary conditions, in the context of physics problems, are constraints in space, can they exist in ODE's with just one dimension?


08.4: Dynamic Form for ODEs (Theory) ----- 175
A method for breaking up higher order equations into series of coupled first order equations is discussed
worked explicitly for 2nd order newton's equation
more explicitly referring to the symmetric non-ideal potential



08.5: ODE algorithms ----- 177
stepping slowly through time, some of the problems this produces
dynamic time step algorithms alluded to
8.5.1 euler's rule
  basically first order differentiation in reverse
  demands small step size, leads to high round off error, good for bootstrapping

08.6: Runge-Kutta Rule ----- 178
rk4 and rk45 are the gold standard, rk2 will be derived, the others just fiated
taylor expand a hypothetical exact solution
symmetry of expansion removes odd powers of integral
a bit of chicken-egg problem arises in fractional time steps being needed
suggested using euler to do the half step, then rk2 to do a full step
application to the spring problem
an implementation of rk4 is provided
rk45 briefly described as procedurally testing larger step sizes to find optimal scale

08.7: Adams-Bashforth moulton predictor-corrector rule ----- 183
predictor corrector methods take data at multiple time steps
possible typo on page 184, k vectors are recursively defined

08.8: Solution for nonlinear oscillations ----- 187


08.9: extensions: nonlinear resonances, beats, friction ----- 189


08.10: extenion: time-dependent forces ----- 190
