03.1: Types of errors ----- 53
  intro makes a warning about how error tracking is tedious but necessary
  brief example of how tiny errors compound over relatively few steps
  error categories:
    fundamental misunderstanding
    random errors in machine level fluctuations
    approximation error from finite representation of infinite sums
    rounding errors contributed from floating point arithmetic
  worst case scenario, subtraction of comparable numbers
  p 3.1.2 subtractive cancelation exercise
    2 approaches to quadratic equation shown
    dangerzone described
      a: implement quadratic equation solver
      b: investigate error situations
      c: extend program to highlight reliable roots
    oscilating series described S1
    method for minimizing subtractions shown S2
    method for eliminating substractions altogether shown S3
      a: implement all 3 sums
      b: treating S3 as the exact answer, do loglog plots of relative error
      c: inspect for power laws
    addition is not commutative :/
      a: implement up sum and down sum
      b: plot log log (su-sd)/(su + sd)
      c: observations
  3.1.3 round off errors
    division errors are linearly additive
    basic uncorrelated error propogation is asserted to work
  error accumulation
    random walk argument, warnings of constructive interference in errors
03.2: Error in Bessel functions ----- 58
  spherical bessel functions defined
  some analytic uses described
  a recursion relation is provided
  doing the reverse recurrence relation seems like begging the question a little...
  1: implement both methods and get values for l 0 to 25 at .1, 1 10
  2: get at least one method to have errors less than 10^-10
  3: show convergence and stability of results, some how
  4: compare relative difference
  5: discuss error as a function of x
03.3: Experimental Error Investigation ----- 62
  salient questions about quality of a numerical method
    convergence, precision, efficiency
  expressions for systemic and rounding error described
    a/n**b vs c*n**.5
  a heuristic about the transition between which dominates described
  a comparison approach
  an example comparing the  convergence rate of 2 toy models and finding ideal step amount
  revisiting sin function
    take implementation and compare with library implementation
    but generate terms and not necessarily sum immediately
    reproduce graph 3.4  comparing errors with term count
